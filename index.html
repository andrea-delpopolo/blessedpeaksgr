                <p>
                    Mountain biking is a thrilling sport that involves riding
                    bicycles off-road on rough and rugged terrain, such as
                    mountains, hills, and forests. It's a great way to stay
                    active and explore the great outdoors, while also pushing
                    yourself to new limits and improving your overall fitness.
